        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 boneless, skinless chicken breast (about 2/3 lb.)</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp cooking oil</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 tsp grated fresh ginger</li>
            <li>1.5 cups uncooked jasmine rice</li>
            <li>2.5 cups water</li>
            <li>12 oz. frozen stir fry vegetables</li>
            <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 tsp toasted sesame oil</li>
            <li>2 green onions, sliced</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the chicken breast into very small pieces, about 1/2 to 
                3/4-inch in size.</li>
            <li>Add the cooking oil, garlic, and ginger to a large, deep skillet. 
                Cook over medium heat for about 1 minute, then add the chicken 
                pieces and continue to sauté just until the outside of the chicken 
                is no longer pink. Do not over cook the chicken here, it will 
                finish cooking with the rice.</li>
            <li>Add the uncooked rice to the skillet and continue to sauté for 1-2 
                minutes more. You should hear the rice popping. Finally, add the 
                water and give everything a brief stir to make sure there is no 
                rice stuck to the bottom of the skillet.</li>
            <li>Place a lid on the skillet, turn the heat up to medium-high, and 
                allow the water to come to a full boil. Once boiling, turn the heat 
                down to low and let it simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the skillet is simmering over low, prepare the teriyaki sauce. 
                In a small bowl, stir together the soy sauce, brown sugar, and 
                toasted sesame oil. The brown sugar may not fully dissolve, but 
                that's okay. Set the sauce aside.</li>
            <li>After the rice has simmered for 10 minutes, lift the lid briefly to 
                sprinkle the frozen vegetables on top, then replace the lid 
                immediately. Make sure the vegetables are spread evenly over the 
                surface. Let the skillet continue to heat over low for an additional 
                five minute.</li>
            <li>After steaming the rice and vegetables together for 5 minutes, turn 
                the heat off and let the skillet rest with the lid in place for an 
                additional five minutes.</li>
            <li>Give the teriyaki sauce another brief stir, lift the lid on the 
                skillet, and drizzle the sauce over the vegetables. Make sure to 
                scrape out all the sugar from the bottom of the bowl. Using a spatula 
                or large spoon, gently fold the rice and vegetables together until 
                everything is mostly coated in the sauce. Make sure to scoop all the 
                way to the bottom of the skillet when folding, as the sauce will sink 
                to the bottom.</li>
            <li>Place the lid back on top and let the skillet rest for a final 5 
                minutes to let the flavor soak in (heat turned off). Sprinkle sliced 
                green onions over top just before serving.</li>
        </ol>
